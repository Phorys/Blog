A recipe to make a pie, but the key of it is not the flavours, but the contents of the pie fillings, which provides a good base for adding for instance sausages and spinach.

## Stats:
Time to prepare: 60 minutes  
Serves: 4  
Combines well with: 

## Ingredients:
- Pie dough (Storebought/Homemade) (1 piece)
- Eggs (5 pcs)
- Crème Fraîche (2 dl)
- Milk (Semi-skimmed) (2.5 dl)
- Grated cheese (100g)
- Bread crumbs (10-25g)
- Salt & black pepper
Optional:
- Sausages (200g)
- Spinach (100g)


## Method:
1. Put the dough into a pie dish and prepare it according to the packaging and cut any excess off, to be added later 
2. Poke holes in the dough with a fork and distribute the bread crumbs evenly
3. Add eggs, crème fraîche, milk, 50g of the cheese and salt and black pepper to a bowl and whisk it together.
4. (Flavourings: Sausages and spinach) Cook your flavourings (If they cannot be eaten as they are). Dice your flavourings and add them to the mixture in the bowl and mix well
5. Add the flavourings into the pie dish on top of the dough and put the remaining cheese on top followed by the excess dough from step 1.
6. Cook the pie for a minimum of 25 minutes at 200°C in the middle of a hot air oven (If not hot air, cook at 225° for the same time)
7. After 25 minutes, check if the filling has set by putting into the middle of the pie - If it comes away clean it should be fine, otherwise add another 5 minutes and repeate until set. (Sometimes it has taken as long 40 minutes to get the desired result.)
