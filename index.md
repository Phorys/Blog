title: "Welcome!"

The purpose for this is for me to be able to have a single place, where I keep the recipes I like and intend to cook more than once. If anyone else happens to like them as well, that's only an added benefit. The recipes are intended to not be full meals, but more recipes for components that can be combined with other recipes. The main benefit of this that it is easier to write them down, but this also means that in terms of nutritional values, the recipes can rarely stand on their own. I will however add suggestions on combinations, which should hopefully help to provide more complete meals.
